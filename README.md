# Machine-Learning-Predictive-Models-of-CO2-Emissions

### Project Overview
This project involve 3 machine algorithms (Linear, multiple linear and polynomial regression ) ,for predicting CO2 Emissions base on cars features such as Cylinders, Engine Size and Fuel Consumption.

### Data
The primary data source used for the machine learning algorithm is the 'Fuel.CSV' which contained all detailed information about the CO2 Emmissions of different cars
Data Source [Download file here](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ML0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module%202/data/FuelConsumptionCo2.csv)
-NB: I renamed the file from FuelConsumptionCo2.csv to 'fuel'

### Tools
1) Google Colab
2) Python

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
The data is clean with no missing values

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involve exploring the key independent varaible which can have possitive correlation  with the dependent variable 'CO2 Emmissions'
ploting of regression plots of the training data using Matplotlip and Seaborn to evalute linear relationships between variables.

### Machine Learning Algorithms
Algorithms involved Regression
1) Linear Regression
2) Multiple Linear Regression
3) Polynomial Regression

### Model Training
The training involved spliting the data into training set and test with '80%' of the ovarall data allocated for training and '20%' for testing.

### Model Evaluation
Included 4 model evaluation techniques
1) Absolute Mean Absolute Error (AMAE)
2) Mean Squared Error (MSE)
3) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
4) R-squared (RÂ²)

### Results
The results of the predictionso of all models was examined, evaluated and compared amongst each other. It showed that the best performing model is Multiple Linear Regression with the lowest MSE and highest R-squared. 

### Recommendations
Based on the results, I recommend implementing the Multiple Linear Regression Model for any applications related to CO2 Emmissions produced by cars.
